# Jatt

-   Small town of about 500 inhabitants
-   The mayor has been here for about 20 years now, and people seem to like them
-   Rarely gets visited by travelers as the place is quite out of the way
-   Never experienced strange phenomenons like this one
-   Is rather safe, although leaving Jatt unprepared is not recommended as monster sightings are common
-   Although religion is important for people living here, there is no official religious facilities

## Town Hall

-   Small town hall with a few employees doing tedious and uninteresting tasks
-   The mayor is generally in their office during the day (7 a.m - 20 p.m)

### The Great Orb of Divination

-   This is a very special orb, displayed in the main hall of the Town Hall
-   It is known and said to only be an artistic object, but it is pretty valuable
-   Hélène, being afraid of people stealing it, put a protective spell on it, transporting the orb outside the Material Plane if it leaves its pedestal

## Market Place

-   At night, this place is completely desert, except for a few passerby

### Great Market Day

-   (during the Scapegoat story line) On the day the adventurers reach Jatt, the Great Market Day is held, Anna summons monsters to unite with the adventurers

## Black Hammer

-   This is the only inn of the town, always crowded at night, but rather empty otherwise
-   The innkeeper Joris is nice and welcomes anyone who wants to consume alcohol warmly
-   The night often ends with 'kind' brawls, before the inn closes. Bets are often taken during those brawls, regarding who will be standing last or who will lose a tooth tonight
-   During the day, Tarik can generally be met in the inn

### Fermented Wasps

-   The online place in the world where Fermented Wasps can be consumed (upon consumption: CONST save throw DC 12, on fail, the consumer is absolutely drunk)
-   Joris refuses to serve the beverage normally, unless for a very good price, or by losing a bet, or by being shown how strong the customer is

## The barn

-   The owner of the barn, Loïc, is always there and lives in a shed near the barn
-   There are quite a few animals surrounding the barn, as well as a lot of crops (cows, sheep, bees, goats, ...) and (wheat, peas, carrots, ...)

### Cluth

### Locked room in the barn

-   The barn holds a secret room, hidden under a trap door (itself hidden and locked)
-   The room is rather small and contains not much, except for a beast, formerly Loïc's son, Vlad
