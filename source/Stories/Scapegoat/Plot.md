# Scapegoat storyline

## Preamble of Scapegoat

The story has been written as the first adventure of a group of characters, hence some information and details may relate to the group getting to know each other, or meeting for the first time. Moreover, the story as been designed with the intent of giving a secret objective to each player. These objectives have been requested by the original players, and were included in the story with a twist. These are not meant to be difficult, and should be done during the storyline of Scapegoat. Finally, the story has been designed for a cast of 4 adventurers at level 3, and for an average of 2-3 sessions.

## Plot of Scapegoat

The story takes place in the kingdom of Khanate, in the small town of Jatt (modern day Ukraine, Crimea).

Before the start of the storyline, at an indeterminate time, Vlad, son of Loïc, farmer in the town of Jatt, is transformed into an [aberration](<../../Monsters/Jatt/Vlad%20(aberration).png>) while protecting his father from a thief. Vlad is trapped under The Barn in Jatt, fed by Loïc but hidden from anyone else. Tarik, an inhabitant of Jatt, is aware of the situation and knows how to save Vlad, but refuses to do so as it requires to sacrifice a living being (Loïc is unaware of the Salvation Rite).

The adventurers all were in Yorlip (the capital of the kingdom) when they were approached by a mysterious figure (Anna disguised). She gave each adventurer some information about something interesting to do in Jatt (see Special Missions during Scapegoat). Each adventurer therefore heads to Jatt. Prior to the arrival of the adventurers to Jatt, Anna goes there and murders a goat as part of the Invocation of the Eye of Despair. The murder (and all subsequent murders) occurred around The Barn. Loïc has informed Hélène (the mayor of Jatt), and they both take this case seriously, as the murder does not look like anything natural.

The adventurers arrive separately to the town, during the Great Market Day, an event happening once a month in this town. The adventurers have some time to explore the Market Place, before a pack of 4 [Dire Wolves](../../Monsters/Jatt/Dire%20Wolf.png) arrives and attacks the crowd. Anna, gathers the adventurers by asking for brave fighters to protect the town with her. A fight ensues, in which Anna helps lightly (unless the adventurers are in great danger). After winning the fight, the adventurers and Anna are approached by Hélène, who asks them to help with mysterious goat murder.

During the fight, Anna must take anything related to every adventurer (hair, scale, nail, ...), in order to complete the Invocation of the Eye of Despair. These body parts are used to link each adventurer to a specific goat through the Soul Link spell (unique to Anna). Upon achieving something great, according to them (i.e: their Special Missions during Scapegoat) the death of the related goat is triggered within five minutes at most.

From this point onwards, the adventurers decide the course of events that will unfold.

## Main quest during Scapegoat

The main quest of this storyline is to solve the mystery surrounding the goats being murdered. It is unlikely that the adventurers figure out the whole plot before completing their Special Missions during Scapegoat. The most probable ending is to summon the Eye of Despair, and to destroy him during a difficult fight. Nonetheless, hints are meant to be given to the adventurers, showing that their actions trigger the death of goats. Moreover, hints should be given in order to incriminate Anna. Upon summoning the Eye of Despair, it should be clear (through a Insight or Arcana roll if necessary) that :

-   The goats were sacrificed
-   Loïc is innocent
-   (if discovered) that Vlad has nothing to do with it
-   It is the doings of someone else, possibly a cult
-   That the adventurers were the cause, in some way, of the summoning

Note that it is not mandatory that the adventurers understand that Anna was the antagonist, but in order to properly continue the story, it is preferable.

## Side quests during Scapegoat

The only real side quest is to solve the mystery around Vlad and Loïc. This can be done in many ways, but the best outcome is to save Vlad. Upon saving Vlad, Loïc gives some reward to the adventurers (gold coins, a magic item, ...). The reward is at the discretion of the DM.

## Special Missions during Scapegoat

These missions have been designed for a specific party. They should adapted for your party (or made generic).

Anna is chaotic evil, and likes to make fun of gullible people. All the special missions are meant to be rather dumb, and without real interest.

-   One player must eat a Cluth (Loïc is not meant to give the Cluth for free, and it is very expensive). Only one player can consume the cheese, if not consumed it can be sold for a very good price. Anna lied to the adventurer, telling them that this cheese grants immense powers upon consumption
-   One player must force the party to consume Fermented Wasps. Anna lied to the adventurer, telling him that the beverage is magical, and can render a party of adventurers near invincible upon consumption
-   One player (blood hunter) must steal a scale of another player (Dragon born). Anna lied to the adventurer, telling him that a scale of a green dragon born allows the creation of a new kind of Blood Curse, more powerful than any other
-   One player must steal The Great Orb of Divination. Anna lied to the adventurer, telling him that this item allows its user to see the distant future. She mentioned that the secret is well kept by the inhabitants of Jatt, as they are afraid of thieves coming for the orb
