### [General](<vlad.md#general>)

-   Has become an [aberration](<../../Monsters/Jatt/Vlad%20(aberration).png>) with [illustration](<../../assets/Vlad%20(aberration).jpg>) while defending [Loïc](<loïc.md#loïc>) against a thief with magical abilities
-   Is now a mindless beast, attacking anything that comes too close
-   Can be turned back into a human through a [Salvation Rite](<tarik.md#salvation-rite>) (can be performed by [Tarik](<tarik.md#tarik-inns-regular>)) at the cost of a human life

### [Traits](<vlad.md#traits>)

-   Extremely brave, will defend anyone that needs it

### [Flaws](<vlad.md#flaws>)

-   Reckless

### [Goals](<vlad.md#goals>)
